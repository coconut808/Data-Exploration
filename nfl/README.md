Some fun plotting practice based on NFL QB stats
* Who are the passing yards leaders?
* Who are the touchdown leaders?
* What is the ratio of yards to touchdowns? Is there a correlation?

Last years(2024) passing yards leader: Joe Burrow (4918 yards)  
Last years(2024) touchdown leader: Joe Burrow (43 TDs)  

Based on last years data, it suggests that there is a correlation.  
Can the reiging leader repeat twice in a row.  My hypothesis is no since he's currently out with an injury.

I'm starting with week 4 QB data as weekly practice. I won't be adding in the plot images due to sizes.  Can run them in notebook for review.

Note week 5 start, I started pulling data before morning games on 10/5.  Will pull again after the MNF game and that's when I'll run analysis each week after this week
