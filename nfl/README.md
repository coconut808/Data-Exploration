I'm starting with week 4 QB data as weekly practice. I won't be adding in the plot images due to sizes.  Can run them in notebook for review.

Week 4 passing yrds leaders:

| Player | Yards |
|:------ |:------|
| Sam Darnold | 905 |
| Justin Herbert | 860 | 
| Geno Smith| 831 | 

Week 4 TD leaders:

| Player | Yards |
|:------ |:------|
| Lamar Jackson| 9 |
| Aaron Rogers| 8 | 
| Caleb Williams| 7 | 
| Jared Goff | 7 |
