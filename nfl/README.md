I'm starting with week 4 QB data as weekly practice. I won't be adding in the plot images due to sizes.  Can run them in notebook for review.

Note week 5 start, I started pulling data before morning games on 10/5.  Will pull again after the MNF game and that's when I'll run analysis each week after this week
